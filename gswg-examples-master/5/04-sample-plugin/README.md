## Getting Started

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started with Grunt Book](http://gswg.io/) or the [Getting Started Guide](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install --save-dev grunt-gswg
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it can be loaded inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-gswg');
```

## `gswg` task

*Run this task with the `grunt gswg` command.*
